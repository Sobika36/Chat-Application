# Java Chat Room
This is a simple Java program that simulates a basic two-way chat between a server and a client inside a single console. It is useful for understanding how input/output works and how server-client roles can be simulated using Java.

## Project Specifics
- **Console-Based Chat:** Runs entirely in the terminal.
- **Simulated Server-Client Mode:** Choose between server or client at runtime.
- **User Interaction:** Messages are typed manually for both server and client.
- **Exit Option:** Type exit to stop the chat.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java installed (JDK 8 or above)
- A terminal or command prompt

### Steps
**1**.1Open your terminal.
**2**.Compile the file:
        javac Main.java
**3**.Run the program:
        java Main
**4**.When prompted:
  - Enter 1 to act as Server
  - Enter 2 to act as Client
**5**.Type your messages and press Enter.
**6**.Type exit to stop the chat.

### Files Included
Main.java â€“ contains the full code for both server and client modes in one file.

### Disclaimer
- This is a basic simulation, not a real network-based chat system.
- It is designed for educational use only, to practice Java console input/output and control flow.
